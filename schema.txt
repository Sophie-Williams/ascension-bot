Usage:

The server first creates the node under a game id. The clients connect to this
game id and add themselves as nodes under players. Once the server sees two
players, it creates the board node and initializes the players' data. Finally,
it sets current_player_id to the first player to move and current_turn to 1.

Players move by inserting nodes into their own moves/ node. Initially, a player
adds the turn index, move type, and the associated card. The player should then
wait until the server sets the acknowledged property. If the server rejects the
move, the player should not continue playing. The server will mark the move as
acknowledged once it has updated all of the state (e.g., board, hand, etc).

A move can be "acquire" or "defeat" if the card is in the center row and the
player has enough runes or power for it. A move can also be "play" if the player
has the card in his hand. Once the player is done making moves, he sets his
turn_ended node to true.

The server then decides whether the players should keep playing (i.e., if the
game is not over yet). If so, it sets current_player_id to the other player and
marks that player's turn_ended as false.
Otherwise, it sets current_player_id to -1 and sets the victor node to be the
id of the winner. TODO: this doesn't show the total honor counts.

The board's void and center nodes are lists of cards. The Mystics node is the
number of Mystics left in the game (as with Heavy and the Cultist).

Note that the only things a player should modify are his moves and turn_ended.
Everything else should be modified only by the server.
