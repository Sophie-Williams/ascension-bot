Usage:

The server first creates the node under a game id. The clients connect to this
game id and add themselves as nodes under players. Once the server sees two
players, it creates the board node and initializes the players' data. Finally,
it sets the current turn to the first player to move.

A player starts his turn by setting turn ended to false. Players move by
inserting nodes into their own moves/ node. Initially, a player adds the
move type and the associated card. The player should then wait until the
server sets the acknowledged property. If the server rejects the move, the
player should not continue playing. The server will mark the move as
acknowledged once it has updated all of the state (e.g., board, hand, etc).

A move can be "acquire" or "defeat" if the card is in the center row and the
player has enough runes or power for it. A move can also be "play" if the player
has the card in his hand. Once the player is done making moves, he sets the
turn ended node to true.

The server then decides whether the players should keep playing (i.e., if the
game is not over yet). If so, it sets the current turn to the other player.
Otherwise, it sets the current turn to -1 and sets the victor node to be the
id of the winner.

The board's void and center nodes are lists of cards. The Mystics node is the
number of Mystics left in the game (as with Heavy and the Cultist).
